I am second-year Ph.D. student in PKU-PLL, School of Computer Science, Peking University. I am currently advised by Prof. Yingfei Xiong. I also worked with Prof. Hongfei Fu and Prof. Bingkai Lin. I am interested in problems about programs and programming languages, especially in program synthesis, decision procedures and probabilistic program verification. I also have some work on inapproximatability under the parameterized complexity regime.
